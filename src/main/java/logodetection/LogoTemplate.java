/**
 *
 * <p>Descriptors and keypoints are precomputed before matching occurs, so that there is no need to extract features
 * and key points each time. Priority is used to compare the value of the logo templates. The higher the priority,
 * the earlier this logo is checked for presence on the patch. Also logo templates with higher priority have less
 * chance to be removed from the list of logo templates. Finally, each logo template has its own identifier, so
 * that we can distinguish between them.</p>
 * <p>How can we uniquely identify logo template? Since any logo template was
 * extracted from some frame's patch, each logo template is identified by patchIdentifier. patchIdentifier is the
 * identifier of the patch from which this template was extracted. This is only applied to dynamic list of templates
 * that is created during real-time detection. Those that were there from the beginning (original logo templates,
 * loaded during initialization) have not been extracted from the video, and hence their patch identifier have
 * negative frameId and null rectangle.</p>
